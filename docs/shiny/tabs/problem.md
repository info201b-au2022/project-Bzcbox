## Project Framing
Injustices in America continue to arise based on race, income levels, and so much more. The consequences of these injustices impact these groups, as seen through the increased levels of pollution and the distribution of covid-19 deaths. Ultimately, the lack of attention and financial resources lead to the mistreatment of these underprivileged communities, revealing the negative implications of institutional racism. “Institutional racism continues to affect policy decisions related to pollution and other forms of environmental degradation”, stated Robert D. Bullard and Beverly Hendrix Wright (1986). For example, minority communities might be targeted to be used as places for heavy industries, therefore, their living environment could be heavily affected by pollution compared to other communities.

Distributive injustice leads to another social issue of environmental injustice. Income inequality increases the vulnerability of low-income communities while facing pollution and climate change at the individual level compared to other communities. This indicates that as opposed to upper-middle classes residents who take more precautions, like “restricting time outdoors, using indoor air purifiers” (Parris, Hegtvedt, & Johnson, 2020), people who cannot afford better protection from pollution are yet, receiving more pollution burden.

## Human Values

Our human values include factors such as environmental justice, health safety, and access to resources. Oftentimes, pollution may go overlooked as it is not something we can physically see, but can be deadly for communities who do not have access to insurance, are unable to seek medical attention due to their history of medical bills, and much more. If these individuals are already disadvantaged financially, something must be done to address the disproportionate pollution levels based on the varying income levels and population of minorities in a community.

## Direct & Indirect Stakeholders 
Direct stakeholders of our research are communities that suffer from environmental injustice. The living environment of minority and low-come communities are damaged by disproportionate exposure to pollution. A study shows that black residents absorb about 1.5 times the air pollution burden of the population at large (ALEJANDRA BORUNDA, 2021). Drawing more attention from society and raising public awareness of environmental injustice would help to build a larger data set, and more analyses can be done to solve this problem.

The indirect stakeholders of our research are policymakers. Due to the injustice of environmental policies, minority and low-income communities are exposed to a greater danger of pollution which leads to serious health issues. Government institutions and policymakers could be more aware of the discrimination happening toward communities with lower political power and end the injustice at a social level.

## Potential Benefits and Harms
A benefit of this topic is the ability to gather observational data. This can be used to create solutions for the future on how to tackle the issue of pollution in our low income communities. Another benefit is that it can also aid in providing data on the growing number of citizens who lack proper health insurance coverage.  By having this information, there will be a greater effort to design policies that can benefit the most people.  

An obvious harm is that people are getting sick from the concentration of pollutants in the air. This is prevalent in both high and low SES (socioeconomic status) communities however as previously mentioned, those in low SES communities lack the insurance coverage to be treated for their illnesses. This creates a chain reaction, as sick people can’t work and so they cannot bring money in for better living standards. Therefore, these low income neighborhoods are repeating the same cycles, and no one is doing anything about it. However, if changes are made, these neighborhoods will start to rise in their socioeconomic status, which can risk gentrification. Families who may have been living in these homes for generations may be pushed out in order to turn a poor urban area into a place where the wealthier can live.
