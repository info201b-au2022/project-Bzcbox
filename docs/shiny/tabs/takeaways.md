- Given our findings, it goes to show how important it is to take into account the disparities of minority groups, from income brackets, to race, and geographic location. Based on our findings, it was evident that institutional racism exists from air pollution to COVID 19 deaths, all which impact an individual’s quality of life. It was clear that minorities were often the prime culprits of these ongoing issues, which reveals the unfairness of our society’s daily functions. Only by acknowledging this through the collection of data and powerful tools such as R to gain insight, will we be able to make profound changes to our society.

- With the knowledge that minorities are impacted negatively, in terms of pollution and COVID 19 deaths, we can only imagine the other ways their life is impacted. Major changes must be made to the society we live in, to provide equal opportunities for all. These changes can start with the American healthcare system, as healthcare is one of the basic necessities of life to ensure an individual’s success whether in school or in their careers. WIthout a healthcare system that is easily affordable and accessible, minorities will continue on in this cycle of oppression. In terms of pollution, regulations on dumping and factory locations must be improved, to prevent low SES communities from being disadvantaged.

- Furthermore, through our research, we learned that one finding may not accurately explain the circumstances and scope of social injustice. We learned that we must look beyond the results, to hone in on the meaning of it. For example, we discovered that non-Hispanic White individuals had the largest amount of deaths, but because the number of non-Hispanic White individuals dominate the majority of the U.S. population, we must look at the proportion of each race that are impacted. This goes to show the dangers of generalizations of statistics, if further probing is not executed.
