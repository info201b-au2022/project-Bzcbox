## Datasets
</br>


Our dataset will allow us better understand how both income and minority communities are affected by pollution. Because this dataset provides us with insight on low-income nonwhite population-weighted concentrations and high-income white population-weighted concentrations, we may be able to discover which factor (between income or race) has a greater impact on air pollution levels.

#### Air pollution dataset

The first dataset analyzed compares the outdoor NO2 air pollution in the United States, based on different categorizations of race and income. This dataset will allow us to better understand how both income and minority communities are affected by pollution. Because this dataset provides us with insight on low-income nonwhite population-weighted concentrations and high-income white population-weighted concentrations, we may be able to discover which factor (between income or race) has a greater impact on air pollution levels.

#### COVID dataset

Our second dataset displayed the distribution of COVID 19 deaths based on factors such as age, race and state, which can be used to answer the second question. By further analyzing this dataset, we can find whether COVID-19 deaths are related to race, which race suffers the most from the COVID-19, and so on. This dataset is provided by NCHS, National Center for Health Statistics, and the data itself is considered to be convincing and credible.

#### Population dataset
This dataset is meant to be used with the COVID dataset in order to calculate the exact proportion of deaths with people in different race. The original dataset is messy and need to be cleaned up in order to get the data we need to calculate the proportion.
