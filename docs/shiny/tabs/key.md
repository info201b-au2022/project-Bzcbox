#### ***How do environmental issues disproportionately impact lower income POC communities?***

The state that has the greatest number of low income non-white population weighted concreation was New York, and this was the same for the high income white population. From these results, we believe that New York was the outcome for both findings due to the fact that New York consumes more fossil fuels in its buildings than any other states in the country. To explain the outcome between the two opposite demographics, it may be reliant on the fact that New York is the fifth-most diverse state but also has one of the greatest income gaps. For these reasons, the combination of diversity in race and income results in New York.

#### ***How were minorities affected by environmental injustice and biased institutional policies during the COVID-19 pandemic?***

In total, there were **3710** rows of covid observations. Of these observations, it was found that the **greatest number of deaths** when observed by race were *non-hispanic white individuals*. This was an interesting finding, but could be impacted by numerous factors such as oppression. Oftentimes, people of color may not seek medical attention due to legal or financial reasons, and omissions of these minorities may go unrecorded. We also looked at the race that has the maximum deaths ratio. Because the number of non-white hispanic individuals who were recorded in data was so large, there was also a large number of deaths. Upon looking at the proportions, Non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native and Non-Hispanic Black individuals had the highest proportion of deaths due to covid. Because they are minorities, there are many injustices that result in this outcome such as environmental, healthcare, rights, and much more. With these minorities having the highest deaths ratio, we should take into consideration the fact that as a minority group, they may live in areas of low SES, where dumping and polluting industries reside. This may increase the deaths ratio as COVID 19 is a respiratory disease, and when coupled with prior exposure to high pollution levels, the likeliness of deaths may increase.
