### Abstract
We are concerned with how environmental injustice is considered to be one form of social injustice. This question is important because environmental injustice can be hard to distinguish, and only a few people realize how devastating it can be. To address this concern, we plan to use datasets in order to prove the increasing spread of environmental injustice in the United States.

**Keywords:** Income, Social Injustice, Environmental Injustice, Underprivileged Minority Groups

### Introduction

Evidence suggests that the effects of different kinds of disease are not experienced equally among different races of the US population – Minority and low-income communities suffer from the biased policies such that their rights to be treated equally have been violated. High population density, more frequent use of public transportation, exposure to an environment with bad air quality, different educational and financial status, and constant pressure from society, all these factors can lead to a more serious outcome for both physical and mental health of those who suffer from social injustice. In this project, we will mainly focus on how social and environmental injustice affects minorities’ physical health across the United States.

### Problem Domain

#### **Project framing**

Injustices in America continue to arise based on race, income levels, and so much more. The consequences of these injustices impact these groups, as seen through the increased levels of pollution and the distribution of covid-19 deaths. Ultimately, the lack of attention and financial resources lead to the mistreatment of these underprivileged communities, revealing the negative implications of institutional racism. “Institutional racism continues to affect policy decisions related to pollution and other forms of environmental degradation”, stated Robert D. Bullard and Beverly Hendrix Wright (1986). For example, minority communities might be targeted to be used as places for heavy industries, therefore, their living environment could be heavily affected by pollution compared to other communities.
Distributive injustice leads to another social issue of environmental injustice. Income inequality increases the vulnerability of low-income communities while facing pollution and climate change at the individual level compared to other communities. This indicates that as opposed to upper-middle classes residents who take more precautions, like “restricting time outdoors, using indoor air purifiers” (Parris, Hegtvedt, & Johnson, 2020), people who cannot afford better protection from pollution are yet, receiving more pollution burden. 



#### **Human values**

Our human values include factors such as environmental justice, health safety, and access to resources. Oftentimes, pollution may go overlooked as it is not something we can physically see, but can be deadly for communities who do not have access to insurance, are unable to seek medical attention due to their history of medical bills, and much more. If these individuals are already disadvantaged financially, something must be done to address the disproportionate pollution levels based on the varying income levels and population of minorities in a community. 



#### **Stakeholders**

- Direct stakeholders of our research are communities that suffer from environmental injustice. The living environment of minority and low-come communities are damaged by disproportionate exposure to pollution. A study shows that black residents absorb about 1.5 times the air pollution burden of the population at large (ALEJANDRA BORUNDA, 2021). Drawing more attention from society and raising public awareness of environmental injustice would help to build a larger data set, and more analyses can be done to solve this problem.

- The indirect stakeholders of our research are policymakers. Due to the injustice of environmental policies, minority and low-income communities are exposed to a greater danger of pollution which leads to serious health issues. Government institutions and policymakers could be more aware of the discrimination happening toward communities with lower political power and end the injustice at a social level.



#### **Potential Benefits and Harms**

- A benefit of this topic is the ability to gather observational data. This can be used to create solutions for the future on how to tackle the issue of pollution in our low income communities. Another benefit is that it can also aid in providing data on the growing number of citizens who lack proper health insurance coverage.  By having this information, there will be a greater effort to design policies that can benefit the most people.  

- An obvious harm is that people are getting sick from the concentration of pollutants in the air. This is prevalent in both high and low SES (socioeconomic status) communities however as previously mentioned, those in low SES communities lack the insurance coverage to be treated for their illnesses. This creates a chain reaction, as sick people can’t work and so they cannot bring money in for better living standards. Therefore, these low income neighborhoods are repeating the same cycles, and no one is doing anything about it. However, if changes are made, these neighborhoods will start to rise in their socioeconomic status, which can risk gentrification. Families who may have been living in these homes for generations may be pushed out in order to turn a poor urban area into a place where the wealthier can live.

### Research questions

#####  *How do environmental issues disproportionately impact lower income POC communities?*

This question is important to address as the disadvantages of lower income POC communities stem beyond the lack of resources. Rather, these disadvantages are due to hazardous waste sites, industrial facilities and other locally unwanted land uses are typically present in these communities, and these institutions must be held accountable for this environmental injustice. 

##### *How were minorities affected by environmental injustice and biased institutional policies during the COVID-19 pandemic?*

For minorities and low-income communities, living in an environment exposed to disproportionate pollution might lead to serious health issues that make them more vulnerable while facing viruses like the COVID-19 pandemic. Studying the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic posed on minority communities can help us to better demonstrate how environmental injustice threatens minorities’ physical health.


### The Dataset:

| FileName                | Columns     | Rows     |
| -----------             | ----------- | -------  |
| air_data.xlsx           |     11      |   449    |
| covid_19_data.csv       |     13      |   3711   |
| population_usafacts.csv |     123     |   365    |

Our dataset will allow us better understand how both income and minority communities are affected by pollution. Because this dataset provides us with insight on low-income nonwhite population-weighted concentrations and high-income white population-weighted concentrations, we may be able to discover which factor (between income or race) has a greater impact on air pollution levels.


#### Air pollution dataset

The first dataset analyzed compares the outdoor NO2 air pollution in the United States, based on different categorizations of race and income. This dataset will allow us to better understand how both income and minority communities are affected by pollution. Because this dataset provides us with insight on low-income nonwhite population-weighted concentrations and high-income white population-weighted concentrations, we may be able to discover which factor (between income or race) has a greater impact on air pollution levels. 

#### COVID dataset

Our second dataset displayed the distribution of COVID 19 deaths based on factors such as age, race and state, which can be used to answer the second question. By further analyzing this dataset, we can find whether COVID-19 deaths are related to race, which race suffers the most from the COVID-19, and so on. This dataset is provided by NCHS, National Center for Health Statistics, and the data itself is considered to be convincing and credible.

#### Population dataset

This dataset is meant to be used with the COVID dataset in order to calculate the exact proportion of deaths with people in different race. The original dataset is messy and need to be cleaned up in order to get the data we need to calculate the proportion.


### Expected implications

An expected implication for our project topic can be that those living in lower SES communities are more likely to have a greater concentration of pollutants in their air. Due to this, the people are more likely to suffer the consequences in regards to their health, as this creates a threat of lung and cardiovascular disease. Another implication is that those in higher SES communities may also have a dangerous level of pollutants in their air and may also be equally susceptible to disease, but since they are more likely to have better insurance coverage, they have a better chance of recovering. On the other hand, people living in lower income communities are less likely to have good enough coverage or coverage at all and so this leads to their health declining more. 

#### Limitations

Some limitations we may need to address on the dataset regarding race and income versus level of air pollution is the lack of representation; the only two categories include low-income nonwhite population-weighted concentrations and high-income white population-weighted concentration. Although this provides a good insight and may indicate the environmental injustices that are present, there are also non-white individuals who may be high income, and alternatively, low-income white individuals. The omission of these groups may skew the data, and lead to an inaccurate conclusion. Additionally, the second dataset contains quite a deficit of data as n/a is listed in the dataset. A lack of data collected may lead to limitations as we are unable to understand the bigger picture of how communities of color are impacted by healthcare, and therefore we cannot accurately assess injustices that are present. 

### Findings 

####  How do environmental issues disproportionately impact lower income POC communities?

The state that has the greatest number of low income non-white population weighted concreation was New York, and this was the same for the high income white population. From these results, we believe that New York was the outcome for both findings due to the fact that New York consumes more fossil fuels in its buildings than any other states in the country. To explain the outcome between the two opposite demographics, it may be reliant on the fact that New York is the fifth-most diverse state but also has one of the greatest income gaps. For these reasons, the combination of diversity in race and income results in New York.

####  How were minorities affected by environmental injustice and biased institutional policies during the COVID-19 pandemic?

In total, there were 3710 rows of covid observations. Of these observations, it was found that the greatest number of deaths when observed by race were non-hispanic white individuals. This was an interesting finding, but could be impacted by numerous factors such as oppression. Oftentimes, people of color may not seek medical attention due to legal or financial reasons, and omissions of these minorities may go unrecorded. We also looked at the race that has the maximum deaths ratio. Because the number of non-white hispanic individuals who were recorded in data was so large, there was also a large number of deaths. Upon looking at the proportions, Non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native and Non-Hispanic Black individuals had the highest proportion of deaths due to covid. Because they are minorities, there are many injustices that result in this outcome such as environmental, healthcare, rights, and much more. With these minorities having the highest deaths ratio, we should take into consideration the fact that as a minority group, they may live in areas of low SES, where dumping and polluting industries reside. This may increase the deaths ratio as COVID 19 is a respiratory disease, and when coupled with prior exposure to high pollution levels, the likeliness of deaths may increase. 

### Discussion

Given our findings, it goes to show how important it is to take into account the disparities of minority groups, from income brackets, to race, and geographic location. Based on our findings, it was evident that institutional racism exists from air pollution to COVID 19 deaths, all which impact an individual’s quality of life. It was clear that minorities were often the prime culprits of these ongoing issues, which reveals the unfairness of our society’s daily functions. Only by acknowledging this through the collection of data and powerful tools such as R to gain insight, will we be able to make profound changes to our society. 

With the knowledge that minorities are impacted negatively, in terms of pollution and COVID 19 deaths, we can only imagine the other ways their life is impacted. Major changes must be made to the society we live in, to provide equal opportunities for all. These changes can start with the American healthcare system, as healthcare is one of the basic necessities of life to ensure an individual’s success whether in school or in their careers. WIthout a healthcare system that is easily affordable and accessible, minorities will continue on in this cycle of oppression. In terms of pollution, regulations on dumping and factory locations must be improved, to prevent low SES communities from being disadvantaged. 

Furthermore, through our research, we learned that one finding may not accurately explain the circumstances and scope of social injustice. We learned that we must look beyond the results, to hone in on the meaning of it. For example, we discovered that non-Hispanic White individuals had the largest amount of deaths, but because the number of non-Hispanic White individuals dominate the majority of the U.S. population, we must look at the proportion of each race that are impacted. This goes to show the dangers of generalizations of statistics, if further probing is not executed. 


### Conclusion 

We **must** shed light on these social injustices through protests. Change must start all individuals in society and undermine the power that promotes and sustains these social injustices. Sometimes, it takes a large movement to get the attention of those who hold power. We have seen numerous protests in the past such as Black Lives Matter, and how much reform has come with this protest. We can apply these strategies in order to alleviate the oppression of low SES and minority groups. 

With environmental impacts for low SES communities being around for decades, only worsening as our population continues to dangerously grow and fossil fuels continue to be used to fulfill the operations of a selfish and unsustainable society, the only solution to prevent low SES communities from being disadvantaged is by creating laws to ensure these communities are not mistreated. Given that not enough changes have been made to this day, the only way to grab the attention of policymakers and society is through protesting. 

In addition, although COVID 19 has not been around for nearly as long as environmental pollution, COVID 19 gives us insight into the healthcare system, and the lack of attention provided towards those of low SES or minorities. The high proportion of deaths may come from the financial burdens, preventing these individuals from receiving the proper treatment required. Healthcare in America has proved to be broken with the highest costs to receive treatment. Despite being costly, the price is not reflected in its quality. The patient care experiences have been poor as structural racism has been so deeply ingrained, further preventing minorities from reaching out to hospitals. The healthcare system in America and diversity among staff must be improved to get individuals the treatment they need.
