### Introduction

Evidence suggests that the effects of different kinds of disease are not experienced equally 
among different races of the US population – Minority and low-income communities suffer from the biased
policies such that their rights to be treated equally have been violated. High population density,
more frequent use of public transportation, exposure to an environment with bad air quality,
different educational and financial status, and constant pressure from society,
all these factors can lead to a more serious outcome for both physical and mental health of those who suffer from social injustice.
In this project, we will mainly focus on how social and environmental injustice affects minorities’ physical health across the United States.
