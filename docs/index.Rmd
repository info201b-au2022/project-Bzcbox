### Chart 1
```{r echo=FALSE}
AirGini_plot
```

In order to compare the Gini Coefficient, which measures the income inequality of the state, with the 
Atkinson index, which displays the NO2 concentration. This graph best allows us to visualize how these 
wealth inequalities compare to trends in air pollutants, and whether there is a positive or negative
correlation. We see that there is a high positive correlation between the two factors, meaning that income levels have a strong impact on the level of air pollution.
